Project Name:
    BeatMaker

Main Idea:
     For iPad/iPhone: Handle recording, organizing, and playback of recorded
     sounds.

Features:
    Record, name, and save sounds.
    Choose a group of sounds to sample for playback.
    Via a drum-machine-like GUI, select rythym and volume of individual sounds.
    Allow for not just 16th note segments, but 'tap-and-drag' support for longer
    sound files.
    Select a playback tempo.
    Playback (and possibly record) the sounds in the beat, allowing for live
    editing.
