What is it?:
    Look at sample code!! Don't read documentation.
    Audio Units
        Plug-in arch for handling input and output of raw data &
        synchronization.
    Audio file, Covnerter and codec Services
        Reading and writing
    Clock
        Represent stuff via a graph.
    Hardware & drivers
        Synch of audio
    MIDI & Music Sequencing Services
        Synch of audio and MIDI data during recording.
    HAL
        If you have special hardware.


Interfaces:
    Microphone
    Mixer Unit
        Incredibly customizable!
    List of interfaces on slides.
    Clock API for synch.
    OpenAL is cool.
    Audio Unit Services:
        Talk to devices without talking to hardware.
    Audio Processing Graph API
        Can change pitch in real time w/o changing tempo.
        Delay unit. Echo effects.
        Gets all compressed to a generic file, goes into mixer, and then saved
        or whatever.
        NEVER send data from one core audio unit to multiple units. USE A
        SPLITTER UNIT.

    Core MIDI
        Core MIDI -> MIDI Server -> MIDI Instrument
            MIDI Server: Synchronization
    Clock API
        Reference clock to synch applications or devices.
        A standalone timing source.
        Playback rate can be globally adjusted.
        Time can be translated to SMTPE or MIDI coding.
    OpenAL
        Simulates 3D sound.
        Cross platform.


Common Tasks:
    Reading/Writing Audio Data
        Can be circular and happen in real time.
    Aggregate Devices
        Layer of abstraction.
        Things appear as one single device.
    Handling MIDI
        lots of stuff.
        Recording real time.
        Mixing audio sources.
