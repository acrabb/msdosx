Setter Semantics
****************
'assign'    - simple assignment (default)
'retain'    - invoke retain upon object assignment
'copy'      - assign a copy of the object. !!![Sets the COPY's ref count to 1]!!
'retainCount' - DON'T rely on this. 


Avoiding Cyclic References
**************************
A->B->A
Classic Rule: Parents retain their children. Children don't retain their parents.
