Displaying Data in a Table View
    Don't just put/load stuff in an array.
    Use object to load data as needed.
        UITableViewDataSource
        Cell Reusability
        BOOL values specify editability.

    Don't use selection for state.
    General rule, item is selected iff your finger is on it.
    Disable selection: willSelectRowAtIndexPath
        or tableView.allowsSelection = NO;
    
UITableViewController
    call resetView if the data changes.

    Can set text/image for table view rows.
