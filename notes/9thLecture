Delegation
***********

Delegating object keeps reference to the delegate and sends messages to it when events are triggered.

Window sends 'windowShouldClose' to delegate. Delegate responds No.
Better than subclassing.

NSApplicationDelegate

-(void) applicationdidFinishLaunching:(NSNotification *) something;

NSWindowDelegate
- not in iOS

windowWillMiniturize
...WillEnterFullscreen
...DidEnterFullscreen
...ShouldClose
- Only called when the red 'X' is clicked. Not on Quit.
